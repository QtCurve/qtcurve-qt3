Installation
------------
To build and install:

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. make install


Creating Distribution Packages
------------------------------

CMake (as of v2.4.x) does not support building rpm or deb packages, and a simple
checkinstall will not work. CMake 2.6 should support rpm and deb packages, but until
then I have supplied a simple shell script to build a package with checkinstall.
To use this:

1. Install QtCurve as described above
2. From within the 'build' folder from step 2 above, call ../common/mkpkg
3. Answer the checkinstall questions.
