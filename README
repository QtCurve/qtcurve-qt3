Installation
------------
To build and install:

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. make install


Themes
------
As of v0.55, you can create QtCurve based themes. These will appear with KDE's style
control panel's combobox of styles. To create a new theme, select 'QtCurve' from
within KDE's style panel, then configure QtCurve as required. After this, in QtCurve's
config dialog, select 'Export theme' from the options menu button. You will then be
prompted to give your new 'theme' a name, and a comment. QtCurve will then create a file
named 'qtc_<name>.themerc (e.g. qtc_klearlooks.themerc) - this will have the following
format:

    [Misc]
    Name=KlearLooks
    Comment=Clearlooks inspired style
    [KDE]
    WidgetStyle=qtc_klearlooks
    [Settings]
    animatedProgress=false
    appearance=gradient
    ....rest of qtcurve settings...

To use this theme, either copy qtc_<name>.themerc to
$KDEHOME/share/apps/kstyle/themes/ (usually ~/.kdee/share/apps/kstyle/themes/)
or copy to <kde install prefix>/share/apps/kstyle/themes/ (usually
/usr/share/apps/kstyle/themes/)

When KDE's style panel is restarted, your new theme should appear in the list.


Creating Distribution Packages
------------------------------

CMake (as of v2.4.x) does not support building rpm or deb packages, and a simple
checkinstall will not work. CMake 2.6 should support rpm and deb packages, but until
then I have supplied a simple shell script to build a package with checkinstall.
To use this:

1. Install QtCurve as described above
2. From within the 'build' folder from step 2 above, call ../common/mkpkg
3. Answer the checkinstall questions.
