KDE: Better konqueror active (?) icon border.
KDE: Combobox popup should be drawn as a popup menu - ala Gtk.
ALL: Highlight tab bar? Not sure Gtk can do this :-( (qt gtk theme engine doesn't!)
--app specific--

OO.o:
KDE: 2.x no highlight on combofocus.

KDE: Combo box has a lighter grey when disabled
KDE: Slight re-draw error on tabs if width of all tabs= width of tab bar -- but
     all KDE themes seem to suffer from this.
KDE: Mising white pixel when last tab is selected, if its added then the above 
     suffers even more!
KDE: V3 Combobox list needs to be rounded in rounded mode - missing pixels, etc.
     Also take into account scrollbar pos? i.e. draw line 1 pixel less on right?
ALL: GTK/KDE have different disabled text behaviour when contrast setting changed!
