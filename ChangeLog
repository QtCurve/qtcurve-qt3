2. ALL: Dont use highlighted text colour to border selected menubar items.

         it draws selected popup menu items white.

         rounded buttons in round mode. (i.e. don't AA the corners)
19: KDE: Modified button size code - KDE3.2's kcalc is smaller now!
20: KDE: Don't flatten combo box arrow area when selected - more GTK like.
21: KDE: Highlight clickable listview headers on mouse over - more GTK like.
22: GTK: HScrollBar fix.
23: KDE: More Gtk like shading of buttons - i.e. always dark when pressed.
24: ALL: Slight change to look of combo-box.
25: KDE: Fix for tabwidgets in konqueror, etc.

0.16
----
1: ALL: Use "button text" colour for default button indicator, apart from when in
        rounded mode (i.e. V3)
2: ALL: V3 - Embolden font of default button.
3: ALL: V3 - Lighter background for disabled check/radios.
4: ALL: V3 - Correct AA colour for radio indicator.
5: KDE: Draw triangular tabs the same as rounded - prevous versions defaulted to
        KStyle.
6: KDE: Add 10pix (2*10) border to non-default buttons.
7: KDE: Implement masks for checks and radios - helps with khtml.

0.15
----
1.  KDE: Smaller, more Gtk-like toolbar separators.
2.  ALL: When drawing rounded, use background colour for corner pixels.
3.  ALL: V2, use a shade of the button colour for the default indicator.
4.  ALL: V3, as for V2 above, but "round" the indicator.
5.  KDE: When compiled for Qt 3.2, only highlight pixmap and text on mouse over
         for radio and checkboxes - as these are the only sensitive parts. (Qt < 3.2
         the whole widget is sensitive - and this can expand past text.)
6.  KDE: Fix bottom tabs - i.e. movement of text/icon. (Qt >= 3.2 !)
7.  GTK: Fix bottom tabs on V1
8.  ALL: More rounded buttons, etc.
9:  ALL: Rounded indicator boxes in rounded mode.
10: ALL: Better radio buttons.
11: KDE: Use rounded buttons for Kicker taskbar as well - looks OK now buttons are more
         rounded.
12: GTK: Fix gradient rendering bug - seemed to affect GTK1 glade buttons. (When a partial
         button had to be re-drawn, the whole button was re-drawn instead - clearing out the
         text!)
13: GTK: Use "check" for check and radio's in menus - more Qt like.
14: ALL: V3 - Gradient radio's and checks.

0.14
----
1. GTK2: Set slider width to 16 pixels to better match KDE.
2. GTK: Draw border around toolbar buttons 1 pixel smaller - saves overlap with frame.
3. GTK: Better tabs - GIMP 1.3's tab icons should now move. (GIMP's tabs are shaded
        tho, hmm...)
4. ALL: V3 style uses "pyramid" (i.e. non "V" like) arrows.
5. KDE: Fix for menubar background if button colour != background colour.
6. KDE: Fix for background of "Location:" on konqueror.
7. GTK: Better lsitview headers - smaller, more KDE like.
8. GTK: Reduce differences in V1, V2, and V3 gtkrc files to the bare minimum - ready
        for only 1 (KControl) configurable style.
9. GTK1: Fix (hack really) for range grooves. For some reason these were not being
         drawn when first displayed. Works ok for ranges - but scrollbar grooves are still
         messed up! The redraw only happens after you leave the widget!

0.13
----
1. ALL: New V3 style - has rounded buttons, and uses gradient effect on buttons, tabs,
        scrollbars, etc. 
2. ALL: Code clean-up.

0.12
----
1. KDE: Don't have flat buttons - i.e in printmgr, and kscd.
2. KDE: Default frame width of 1.
3. KDE: Fix mouse-over for some toolbar buttons - the on/off type. Affects most KDE styles,
        but a real KDE fix should be in KDE3.2
4. GTK2: Fix bug where V2 style options were being ignored.
5. GTK2 and KDE: When highlight a depressed button, use a lighter
                 shade of the depressed colour - and not the standard
                 highlight colour.
6. GTK: Active tab bar text is 1 pixel higher - a la KDE.
7. KDE: Fix for borded bottom tabs.

0.11
----
1. GTK2: Fix possible memory corruption.
2. ALL: Square off splitter - more consistent.
3. GTK2: Fix for 2.2.x combo-boxes.

0.10
----
1. GTK2: Better match of menubar height with KDE.
2. GTK:  Fix up/down/left/right arrows.

0.09
----
1. GTK2: Fix scrollbars for 2.2.x - scrolled 1 pixel too much.
2. GTK1: Fix lower spinbutton height. This was OK, so maybe its a Gtk
         change. But from which version? I'm at 1.2.10

0.08
----
1. GTK: Better menu selection.

0.07
----
1. KDE: Reduce min-size of combo-boxes.
2. GTK: Fixes for sodipodi - works with V1, not too good wrt V2...
3. GTK2: Fix for GTK2.2 font setting.

0.06
----
1. GTK: Make combo-boxes thinner.
2. GTK: Allow ussage of GTK1 font substitution file, either 
        /etc/X11/qt_gtk_fnt2fntrc or ~/.qt/gtk_fnt2fntrc, and format:

        <replace from> <with>

        e.g.

        Arial=Helvetica

        This would cause GTK1 apps to use Helvetica, even if KDE/KControl
        has specified Arial. Idea (& patch) supplied by Adrian Schroeter.

0.05
----
1.  ALL: Don't draw lines on scrollbars if less than 20 pixels.
2.  GTK1: Allow to specify x and y thickness's in gtkrc file - as
          happens in GTK2. Fixes bug with small menu entries.
3.  GTK2: Remove 1 pixel border from menus - more consistent with GTK1,
          and KDE - not for V2.
4.  GTK: More KDE-like menu bar entries.
5.  GTK: Re-do weight ranges - would mean 48 is accecpted as "Normal"
6.  ALL: Now 2 styles:
             QtCurve      No borders around buttons, menus, and tab bars
             QtCurve V2   Has borders - more like original B???/FreeCurve
7.  ALL: Number of lines on toolbar handles is now 2, and 4 for scrollbars
         and sliders.
8.  ALL: Dark scrollbar, slider, and progress background - window colour
9.  GTK1: Fix for slider background.
10. GTK2: Fix error with overlapping check/radio highlight on frame.
11. GTK2: Fix spinbuttons.

0.04
----
1.  KDE: Draw box around checked checkable menu item pixmaps.
2.  KDE: Only use small arrows on spinbuttons, and only if size is
         too small for larger.
3.  KDE: Set min button size to 54 and not 70.
4.  ALL: Remove progress bar border.

0.03
----
1.  KDE: Don't highlight disabled menu items - mimics GTK behaviour.
2.  KDE: Progress bar background now matches GTK's.
3.  GTK: Progress bar gradient is now the same as menu bar items - as
         was KDE.
4.  GTK: Progress bar contents now have 1 pixel border like KDE.
5.  GTK: Better spinbutton boxes.
6.  KDE: More GTK like spinbuttons.

0.02
----
1.  Use gtk-config and pkg-config to determine install location for
    GTK 1 and 2 files.

0.01
----
Initial release.
