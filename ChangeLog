 2. KDE: Fix for sliders in kaffeine.
 3. KDE: Finally fixed 'V' arrows!
 4. GTK2: Firefox & thunderbird - edit user's userChrome.css file to set
          KDE buton order, and adjust menu text if using a dark background.
 5. ALL: If using selected for background on menus, automatically use selected
         text colour - as opposed to try to see if its too dark.
 6. GTK: Consistent menubar shade with KDE.
 7. GTK2: Try to set toolbar style, icon size, icons-on-buttons from KDE
          settings.
 8. GTK2: Set alternative button order.

15. KDE: More consistent, with Gtk, menu check boxes.
16. GTK2: Smaller toolbars for AbiWord

13. GTK: More KDE like menu sizing.
14. KDE: Fix/hack for OO.o2.x menubars. If the selected menu color is toodark,
         then lighten. This is required as OO.o always draws the menu text
         dark! It seems to have a check for plastik style though, and then
         it draws selected popup menu items white.

0.25
----

0.21
----
1. ALL: Adjust contrast settings to make lower-contrast the default.

        colour when an app is opened in the background.
2. KDE: Use ::qt_cast<type *>(widget) as opposed to widget->inherits("type") whenever
        possible.
3. GTK2: Compile fix.

0.17.2
------
1. GTK: Compile fix when compiled with KDE<3.2

0.17.1
------
1. KDE: Use Qt 3.1 for ui file - so that will compile with Qt3.2, etc...
        (Using 3.1 as I only have 3.1 and 3.3 installed...)

0.17
----
1.  GTK: Compile fix - used C++ syntax in C code, oops...
2.  GTK2: Make focus rects more like KDE's
3.  KDE: Allow combo-boxes and scrollbars to be recoloured.
4:  ALL: If compiled with KDE3.2 then there is only 1 style "QtCurve", and
         only 1 set of GTK gtkrc files installed. Variation (V1, V2, V3, or
         custom) can then be selected via KControl.

         (NOTE: When upgrading from KDE3.1, you may wish to uninstall the
         previous QtCurve release - to remove the old V2 and V3 config files)
5:  ALL: Better non-bordered gradient radio/checks.
6:  ALL: Option to use non gradient progress/menu bar indicator.
7:  GTK: Don't shade paned widgets!
8:  ALL: V1 has flat progress bar and menuitems - i.e. no gradient effect.
9:  ALL: If no borders are selected and gradient selected, then use thin border
         for progress bar and menuitems.
10: KDE: Better AA'ing of edges of round buttons.
11: GTK: Fix for background colour of selected text, thanks to David RodrÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½uez GarcÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½
12: ALL: Use KDE's contrast setting.
13: KDE: Implement tri-state checkmarks.
14: ALL: Better bottom/right tab gradients.
15: KDE: (Qt>=3.2) the text/icon of a selected bottom tab moves down 1 pixel.
16: KDE: (Qt>=3.2) Only highlight text/check label if mouse is over sensitive area.
17: KDE: Mimic GTK's scrollbar highlighting. i.e. only highlight slider if mouse is
         over slider area, and likewise for the buttons.
18: KDE: When kicker is set to transparent (may need to restart kicker), use "harsh"
         rounded buttons in round mode. (i.e. don't AA the corners)
19: KDE: Modified button size code - KDE3.2's kcalc is smaller now!
20: KDE: Don't flatten combo box arrow area when selected - more GTK like.
21: KDE: Highlight clickable listview headers on mouse over - more GTK like.
22: GTK: HScrollBar fix.
23: KDE: More Gtk like shading of buttons - i.e. always dark when pressed.
24: ALL: Slight change to look of combo-box.
25: KDE: Fix for tabwidgets in konqueror, etc.

0.16
----

2: ALL: V3 - Embolden font of default button.
3: ALL: V3 - Lighter background for disabled check/radios.
4: ALL: V3 - Correct AA colour for radio indicator.
5: KDE: Draw triangular tabs the same as rounded - prevous versions defaulted to
        KStyle.
6: KDE: Add 10pix (2*10) border to non-default buttons.
7: KDE: Implement masks for checks and radios - helps with khtml.

0.15
----
1.  KDE: Smaller, more Gtk-like toolbar separators.
2.  ALL: When drawing rounded, use background colour for corner pixels.
3.  ALL: V2, use a shade of the button colour for the default indicator.
4.  ALL: V3, as for V2 above, but "round" the indicator.
5.  KDE: When compiled for Qt 3.2, only highlight pixmap and text on mouse over
         for radio and checkboxes - as these are the only sensitive parts. (Qt < 3.2
         the whole widget is sensitive - and this can expand past text.)
6.  KDE: Fix bottom tabs - i.e. movement of text/icon. (Qt >= 3.2 !)
7.  GTK: Fix bottom tabs on V1
8.  ALL: More rounded buttons, etc.
9:  ALL: Rounded indicator boxes in rounded mode.
10: ALL: Better radio buttons.
11: KDE: Use rounded buttons for Kicker taskbar as well - looks OK now buttons are more
         rounded.
12: GTK: Fix gradient rendering bug - seemed to affect GTK1 glade buttons. (When a partial
         button had to be re-drawn, the whole button was re-drawn instead - clearing out the
         text!)
13: GTK: Use "check" for check and radio's in menus - more Qt like.
14: ALL: V3 - Gradient radio's and checks.

0.14
----
1. GTK2: Set slider width to 16 pixels to better match KDE.
2. GTK: Draw border around toolbar buttons 1 pixel smaller - saves overlap with frame.
3. GTK: Better tabs - GIMP 1.3's tab icons should now move. (GIMP's tabs are shaded
        tho, hmm...)
4. ALL: V3 style uses "pyramid" (i.e. non "V" like) arrows.
5. KDE: Fix for menubar background if button colour != background colour.
6. KDE: Fix for background of "Location:" on konqueror.
7. GTK: Better lsitview headers - smaller, more KDE like.
8. GTK: Reduce differences in V1, V2, and V3 gtkrc files to the bare minimum - ready
        for only 1 (KControl) configurable style.
9. GTK1: Fix (hack really) for range grooves. For some reason these were not being
         drawn when first displayed. Works ok for ranges - but scrollbar grooves are still
         messed up! The redraw only happens after you leave the widget!

0.13
----
1. ALL: New V3 style - has rounded buttons, and uses gradient effect on buttons, tabs,
        scrollbars, etc. 
2. ALL: Code clean-up.

0.12
----
1. KDE: Don't have flat buttons - i.e in printmgr, and kscd.
2. KDE: Default frame width of 1.
3. KDE: Fix mouse-over for some toolbar buttons - the on/off type. Affects most KDE styles,
        but a real KDE fix should be in KDE3.2
4. GTK2: Fix bug where V2 style options were being ignored.
5. GTK2 and KDE: When highlight a depressed button, use a lighter
                 shade of the depressed colour - and not the standard
                 highlight colour.
6. GTK: Active tab bar text is 1 pixel higher - a la KDE.
7. KDE: Fix for borded bottom tabs.

0.11
----
1. GTK2: Fix possible memory corruption.
2. ALL: Square off splitter - more consistent.
3. GTK2: Fix for 2.2.x combo-boxes.

0.10
----
1. GTK2: Better match of menubar height with KDE.
2. GTK:  Fix up/down/left/right arrows.

0.09
----
1. GTK2: Fix scrollbars for 2.2.x - scrolled 1 pixel too much.
2. GTK1: Fix lower spinbutton height. This was OK, so maybe its a Gtk
         change. But from which version? I'm at 1.2.10

0.08
----
1. GTK: Better menu selection.

0.07
----
1. KDE: Reduce min-size of combo-boxes.

3. GTK2: Fix for GTK2.2 font setting.

0.06
----
1. GTK: Make combo-boxes thinner.
2. GTK: Allow ussage of GTK1 font substitution file, either 
        /etc/X11/qt_gtk_fnt2fntrc or ~/.qt/gtk_fnt2fntrc, and format:

        <replace from> <with>

        e.g.

        Arial=Helvetica

        This would cause GTK1 apps to use Helvetica, even if KDE/KControl
        has specified Arial. Idea (& patch) supplied by Adrian Schroeter.

0.05
----
1.  ALL: Don't draw lines on scrollbars if less than 20 pixels.
2.  GTK1: Allow to specify x and y thickness's in gtkrc file - as
          happens in GTK2. Fixes bug with small menu entries.
3.  GTK2: Remove 1 pixel border from menus - more consistent with GTK1,
          and KDE - not for V2.
4.  GTK: More KDE-like menu bar entries.
5.  GTK: Re-do weight ranges - would mean 48 is accecpted as "Normal"
6.  ALL: Now 2 styles:
             QtCurve      No borders around buttons, menus, and tab bars
             QtCurve V2   Has borders - more like original B???/FreeCurve
7.  ALL: Number of lines on toolbar handles is now 2, and 4 for scrollbars
         and sliders.
8.  ALL: Dark scrollbar, slider, and progress background - window colour
9.  GTK1: Fix for slider background.
10. GTK2: Fix error with overlapping check/radio highlight on frame.
11. GTK2: Fix spinbuttons.

3.  KDE: Set min button size to 54 and not 70.
4.  ALL: Remove progress bar border.

2.  KDE: Progress bar background now matches GTK's.
3.  GTK: Progress bar gradient is now the same as menu bar items - as
         was KDE.
4.  GTK: Progress bar contents now have 1 pixel border like KDE.
5.  GTK: Better spinbutton boxes.
6.  KDE: More GTK like spinbuttons.

0.02
----
1.  Use gtk-config and pkg-config to determine install location for
    GTK 1 and 2 files.

0.01
----
Initial release.
